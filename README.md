# Clean-code-my-own-journey
Get the key ideas from Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

## What is this project? 
I read the book and carefully went through the case studies in the second part, but I still had trouble grasping the concepts. To better understand, I decided to summarize each chapter, compare my understanding with others, and put myself in the author's shoes. By thinking along the same paths as the author, I was able to gain a richer understanding of the principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics.

## Introduction
Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of
principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch
yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and
retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for
making those decisions the wrong way.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of
_Clean Code_.
